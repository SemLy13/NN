pip install numpy

Algorithm of the program:

1. Import the required libraries: NumPy for numerical operations and the time module to measure execution time.

2. Record the start time to measure the execution time of the program.

3. Define the input data (x_in) as a NumPy array containing the input values [[2], [2], [2]].

4. Define the desired output (goal) as a NumPy array containing the target values [[0.3], [0.4], [0.3]].

5. Determine the number of input neurons (N_in) and output neurons (N_out).

6. Define the number of neurons in the two hidden layers (N1 and N2).

7. Initialize random weights for the connections between layers (w1, w2, w3).

8. Set the learning rate (lmb) to 0.1.

9. Define the sigmoid activation function (f(x)) and its derivative (df(x)).

10. Enter the training loop for 5000 iterations.

11. Calculate the weighted sum for the first hidden layer (w1x_in) and apply the activation function to get the output (y1).

12. Repeat the above step for the second hidden layer (w2y1 and y2) and the final layer (w3y2 and out).

13. Calculate the error (e) as the difference between the network's output (out) and the desired output (goal).

14. Compute the delta for the output layer (delta3) as the product of the error and the derivative of the output.

15. Update the weights for the output layer (w3) using gradient descent.

16. Compute the delta for the second hidden layer (delta2) and update its weights (w2).

17. Compute the delta for the first hidden layer (delta1) and update its weights (w1).

18. Display the final output of the neural network.

19. Record the end time of the program execution.

20. Calculate and display the total execution time (end - start).

The program uses a feedforward neural network with two hidden layers to learn the mapping from the input to the desired output through backpropagation and gradient descent. The training process involves updating the weights to minimize the error between the network's output and the target values.
