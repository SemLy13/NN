The algorithm of the "NN_Translator_1" program for training a neural network to translate the input [4, 6] into [0.4, 0.6] is as follows:

1. Initialization: Start by initializing parameters, including input data (x_in) and desired outputs (y_out), the number of input and output neurons (N_in and N_out), as well as the number of hidden layers and neurons (N1 and N2).

2. Activation Functions: Define the activation function (f) and its derivative (df).

3. Weight Initialization: Initialize random weights (w1, w2, w3) for each layer.

4. Training:
   - Perform a training loop (in this case, 5000 iterations).
   - Calculate network predictions for each layer (A, B, and Y) using the current weights and activation function.
   - Compute the error (e) between predictions and desired outputs.
   - Calculate gradients and update weights (w3, w2, w1) using gradient descent and the derivatives of the activation functions.

5. Output: After training, the program outputs the predicted values (Y) and the final weights for each layer (w1, w2, w3).

6. Completion: Measure the program's execution time and display the results.

The program trains a neural network to translate input data [4, 6] into the desired outputs [0.4, 0.6] using backpropagation and gradient descent.
